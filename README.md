# Clarion File Recovery Signatures for Forensic Data Tools

## Overview
Using two forensic file recovery programs PhotoRec [1] and OSForensics [2] to recover Clarion App, Dct and Trf file's because they have at least a leading file signature and sometimes a trailing file signature which makes it easier to recover using File Carvers, programs which use File Carving [3] to recover files off storage mediums like spin disks.
Source code files, CLW, INC, INT, TPW and TPL are pure ascii text files with no file signatures, which make it very difficult to recover unless using a raw storage medium scanner that shows the hex in sectors, where it would be possible to recover with human intervention aka known as a manual recovery.  

Chip based storage like (micro)SD card, USB sticks, SSD drives and NVMe drives are a little less reliable due to the volatile nature of memory chips but are still worth attempting a file recovery from. Chip based storage like (micro)SD cards and others employ a technique called wear levelling [4] which needs to be accounted for. If you want to know more about (micro) SD cards, I would highly recommend reading Bunnie:Studio's for a break down on SD cards and also how to spot fake SD cards. For an example of how spin disks can be hacked I would recommend reading SpriteMods.

## Clarion 11 Dictionary File Signatures

### Leading 24 bytes

Three Example Clarion 11 Dictionary Files: 
  
   aa aa aa    bb bb       cc cc       dd dd dd    ee ee    ff ff ff
   
88 9E 20 80 AB C5 B5 76 90 E8 19 0C 3D 9D 50 E9 AD 0E B5 46 B6 DB CF A6

80 9E 20 80 AF C5 B5 D4 8C E8 19 0C 7F 9D 50 E9 EF 0E B5 48 B6 DB CF BE

8C 9E 20 80 AB C5 B5 E6 8C E8 19 8C 3F 9D 50 E9 A7 0E B5 48 B6 DB CF 86


aa has an offset of 1 from the file start.

bb has an offset of 5

cc has an offset of 9

dd has an offset of 14

ee has an offset of 17

ff has an offset of 20


Valid PhotoRec signatures for the 'photorec.sig' file, but only use one signature in the 'photorec.sig' file.

11dct_bb_sig 5 0xC5B5
		
11dct_cc_sig 9 0xE819

11dct_ff_sig 20 0xB6DBCF


Valid OSForensics signature Header Pattern. OSForensics allows the use ? as a wild card, enabling a more accurate file signature.

### Trailing 24 bytes

Three Example Clarion 11 Dictionary Files:

aa has an offset of 18 from the file end.

bb has an offset of 2

Photorec does not support trailing signatures, instead relying on space on the hard drive sector(s) or another file signature to terminate the existing file.
